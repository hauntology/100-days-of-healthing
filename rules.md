## Rules (Okay, cool. How do I do it?)

1. Work on your health and self care for *at least an hour a day*, starting on January 3, 2017.
2. To track your progress, [fork this repo][gh]. Or consult the FAQ's below.
3. Make a public commitment to the challenge. Use the hashtag #100DaysOfHealthing (preferably on Twitter) to announce your intentions.<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>
4. Tweet about your progress every day using the hashtag. I will, too, over [@jwithy][jwithy].
5. I'll push my progress to Github every day. Follow it [here][gh]. You can, too!

## Some notes and what-have-yous

1. **Don't put yourself at risk.** This is important. For a coding project, you shouldn't be vague; for health, you might need to be.<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup> That's cool. Don't disclose anything that you wouldn't tell your family, your boss, your loved ones, or that dude who was a jerk to you in high school. "Completed my hour of self-care!" isn't vague -- it's acknowledging that some things need to stay private. See the [FAQ's](FAQ.md) for more.
2. **What constitutes self-care and health?** Well, that can totally vary from person to person, but here are some ways I think of it:
	- Going to the doctor for something you've been putting off, or that requires ongoing attention.
	- Meditating, praying, anything like that!
	- Do you need permission to play a video game that totally helps you wind down after a hard day? You've got it!
	- Are you addicted to said video game? Well, maybe reading a book instead would help your self care.
	- Diagnosed with a thing? Reading about strategies to cope, [watching videos that help you learn a thing][howtoadhd], going to a [support group][support]...these are all healthing!
	- What do you want to do that makes you feel like a better you? Coloring? Knitting? Cooking something for friends? Scented candles and tea? Do it do it do it. An hour for you.
3. **Hey I don't work in tech.** That's not an issue at all. See the [FAQs](FAQ.md). All you need to join up is your desire to boost your health!
4. **Send me feedback.** I'm gonna try to make everything accessible and welcoming, but I'm still a [middle-aged white dude][hla] with [his own stuff][unfocused]. Hold me accountable! Contribute or post issues to the repo! Everybody wins!
